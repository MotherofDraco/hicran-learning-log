# Sequence - Similarity - Analyzer
# DNA Similarity Analysis Tool

This project is an analytical tool designed to compare DNA sequences
and calculate similarity scores using algorithmic approaches.

## Problem
Comparing large sequences requires efficient algorithms to detect similarity,
mismatches, and patterns within raw data.

## Solution
This tool processes sequence data, applies similarity algorithms,
and outputs structured results.

## Key Features
- Sequence similarity calculation
- Algorithm-based matching logic
- Modular and extensible design

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Algorithmic sequence matching
- Data analysis & visualization
