# Sequence-Similarity-Analyzer
# DNA Similarity Analysis Tool

This project is an analytical tool designed to compare DNA sequences
and calculate similarity scores using algorithmic approaches.

## Problem
Comparing large biological sequences requires efficient algorithms
to detect similarity, mismatches, and patterns within raw data.

## Solution
This tool processes sequence data, applies similarity algorithms,
and outputs structured results and visualizations that help users
interpret similarity metrics easily.

## Key Features
